## TOP 10 low elo mistakes you need to fix



To start, let's talk about the most common mistake I see among all players..

<h2>Bad Crosshair Placement</h2>


Crosshair placement is arguably one of the most important aspects of improving at Valorant. Crosshair placement is defined as where your crosshair is placed at all times while playing.

This can be during a fight or more commonly is while peeking and holding angles. Many players will hold their crosshairs towards the body or even legs of the opponent. This automatically puts them at a huge disadvantage, and let me explain why.

First it's important to understand how powerful headshots are in Valorant. One headshot can kill players depending on what gun you use, so you obviously want to aim for the head.

Well, if you are aiming for the head, but your crosshair starts at the enemies chest you have to adjust your mouse vertically and horizontally. This forces you to have near perfect aim while trying to hit a headshot on this player.

So instead of having to adjust your entire crosshair vertically and horizontally, you can just always leave your crosshair at about head level.  This will help you get the headshots WAY faster because you don't have to make as many aim
adjustments, and with less distance to travel you'll not only be more accurate, but also have faster reaction times.. Don't forget though, this is important not only while pushing a site, but also while just normally walking around.
You never know when someone will come around a corner so building that muscle memory of always having your crosshair up at head level is super important.

<h2>Peeking Incorrectly</h2>

Our next mistake that low elo players make is peeking incorrectly.
In Valorant there are a ton of ways that you can go about peeking angles. I am going to show you 2 examples of someone clearing B Site on Bind. Both of these players are peeking angles and clearing the site differently.. One is correct and one is not.
Here we see the first player push through long and check there corners then finally they push towards the site while walking through the open. We then see our second player peek long while looking towards site, only peeking 1 angle
at a time if possible. They walk towards site while staying near cover. Could you tell which one was correct? It was the second example. In this example we saw the player peek angles 1 by 1, that way if a player were to peek them, they would be
able to isolate that fight and secure a kill.. If player 1 gets put in that same position then we see they are caught in the open and have to focus on many angles at a time while they take this fight.. Peeking is a key part to Valorant and learning
how to correctly peek angles will help you take more 1 on 1 fights that are much more winnable than just running out.. Another way you can do this is by jiggle peeking. Put simply, jiggle peeking is a method of peeking that allows you to quickly gather
information on where an enemy is without having to risk your life. You can execute this peek by walking up to a wall, then quickly clicking back and forth between the A and D keys so that you barely peek out. This will allow you to peek out without putting yourself in to much danger, and Even if there
is a player on the other side you can even decide to commit to the fight whenever you want.. Peeking one by one and jiggle peeking will give you way more control over your fights.. Mastering these tactics will lead to you getting
more kills and most importantly, staying alive much longer.

<h2>Playing Alone</h2>

let's talk about trading kills and playing off of teammates.. 
Valorant is a very team oriented game, playing it as a solo can be difficult sometimes but learning how to trade kills and play off your teammates is essential to becoming a higher level player.
First, let's talk about exactly what trading kills is. Let's say you teammate pushes site and dies.. You then peek out and kill the player that killed them.. This is a perfect example of trading a kill.
Many times, players will sit back and let their teammates die, just to push in later and have the same fate.. One of the main reasons that trading kills is so effective, is because it puts the enemy in a very difficult situation.
Let's use A Site split as an example. Here we see our teammate die at A main from an enemy that is positioned at screens. We then peek this player from elbow and get basically a free kill.. This is so easy to do because many times the
enemy is not even looking at you when you peek them.

Trading kills also helps to keep the team numbers more balanced during game. It can give your team a 4v4 instead of having to try and fight a 5v4.

Finally, let's go over one mistake that players make while trying to trade. Many times I see someone try to trade but they also just die to the same enemy. This is usually because of the timing. When you trade, you want to make sure you are not
just walking into a death trap, if a player is holding an angle with an awp, it is probably a bad idea to slowly peek out to trade the kill. Instead you want to run out quickly before the player can get another shot off.
Try to pay attention to where your teammates die from so that you can easily trade these kills when your enemy least expects it.. 


<h2>Unnecesary Reloading</h2>

this is reloading in the open and near enemies.
Reloading is a very important aspect of Valorant that many players don't think about. First let's talk about when NOT to reload.. To start, I see many new players reload after only shooting a few bullets. They then will reload and end up dying because they are not
able to defend themselves.. You should only reload when you absolutely need to OR when you are completely safe.. It only takes a few bullets to kill someone in Valorant so reloading after only shooting a few is a terrible idea.
Another reason people die because of reloading is because of their positioning when they reload.. The main idea here is that you don't want to reload in the open. Reloading in the open puts you in an extremely vulnerable situation.
If you get peeked while reloading you will most likely die. This is actually very common to happen also because your reload makes an audio cue. This sound cue happens when you start reloading, this will alert any enemies that are near
you. When they hear this reload, they will peek you because they know they have a free kill.. You can even use this info to get yourself a couple of kills as well, listen for when other players start to reload and peek them then.. 


<h2>Chaotic Spike Defusal</h2>

Many low ELO players don't take control of spike defuse situations because they don't know how. Well, I am going to teach you exactly how you can take control of those situations and win more clutches.. In Valorant the spike takes exactly 7 seconds
to defuse with a halfway point at 3 and a half seconds. There are a lot of different tactics that you can use when you know this information. First, let's go over the fake defuse. A fake defuse is when you click the defuse button
but have no intention to actually defuse the spike. This is called tapping the bomb. When you tap the bomb there will be a sound cue that alerts enemies. This will force the enemies to peek you because they need to make sure you aren't actually
defusing the spike.. You can tap the bomb and then instantly listen for the enemy to figure out exactly where they are coming from. You can then peek them when they least expect it and get a free kill.. Our next spike defusal tip. Is going to be
very similar to the last one but will involve the spikes' halfway point. With this strategy, you will defuse the spike to the half way point and then get off of the defuse and peek the enemy.. This will apply pressure to the enemy and
will give you more time to look for the enemy before you have to finish the defuse. This is most effective when you know for a fact the enemy is to far away to kill you before you get to the halfway point.. And finally, be sure to always listen for
sounds when in clutch situations. The smallest sound could end up winning you the round because you got a crucial piece of information.. 


<h2>Playing all agents/ Not Mastering an Agent</h2>

trying to play every agent. Playing multiple agents randomly is not going to help you improve faster, the best way to improve fast is by learning 1 agent at a time.. Focus on learning just 1 agent and when you feel you have mastered them you can then change and learn another.
This will allow you to learn all the small things about that one agent and will also allow you to always be comfortable with your abilities and your role in the team. You can even look at many of the professional valorant players right now and you will notice
most of them focus on about 3-4 agents that they are very good with. For instance Cloud 9 Tenz focuses a lot on perfecting his Jett, Raze, and Viper. This is one of the reasons Tenz is one of the best. Valorant players in the world right now.
Obviously these players have played enough to focus on more than 1 agent but as a beginner player, you are going to want to master one agent before moving on to another.


<h2>Using Everygun/ Not Mastering a Gun</h2>

Next up we have a similar mistake that players make all the time. I frequently see players try and improve their aim and recoil with all of the guns in Valorant. Now this might seem like a great idea but trying to perfect every single gun at a time can be overwhelming.
Learning how to control recoil and spray patterns is certainly a good way to improve, but you want to focus on just a couple at a time so that you can easily master them.
To start I would recommend practicing with the phantom. You can go here to the training ground and shoot at this target.. Try to get all of your bullets in the inner circle until you can consistently control the spray.
After you learn how to control the phantom, you can switch to the Vandal and practice with it.. Remember, each weapon has a unique spray pattern so learning each one will take time and dedication.. If you manage to learn all of the main weapons
you will no doubt be able to win more gunfights..


<h2>Not Shift Walking When You Have To</h2>


Next, let's focus a little more on sound. In Valorant sound is almost as important as sight. The sounds that enemies make can provide you with valuable information that will net you some free kills.
On the other hand, other players will use sound against you. This is why mistake number 8 is not shift walking.. Shift walking is a key to playing valorant, while shift walking, you will not make any footstep noises. This will allow you to surprise
enemies that don't know your location.. If you decide to run instead of walk then you put yourself at a disadvantage. This is because the enemy will know exactly where you are and you will have no idea where they are.
Another plus to shift walking is the weapon accuracy. Most guns are still fairly accurate while shift walking. This will allow you to be even more prepared for a fight than if you were running.. While you are running you need to stop when
you shoot at the enemy in order to be accurate.. This contrasts how walking works though. While walking you can still move a little and remain fairly accurate.
Even though you may lose some speed while you shift walk, it is still a great idea in most circumstances..

<h2>Shift Walking When You Don't Have To</h2>

 Now mistake # 9 is going to also be about shift walking BUT this one gets players killed even more.
Even though shift walking is ALMOST always a good idea, there are times where it is not. The main time that shift walking is a horrible idea, is when you are peeking an angle. We will refer to this as walk peeking.. When you walk peek an angle the enemy won't
hear you, but your shoulder will show before you can actually see the enemy. This will give your opponent a ton of time to react to you peeking, thus putting them at an advantage and you at a disadvantage.. Instead of doing this, you actually want to
run while you peek it.. What you can do is walk up to wall that you are about to peek. This will allow you to get there without making any noise. Then you want to let go of shift and peek out normally, in most situations you won't actually move
far enough to make noise while you peek.. You can even use the jiggle peek strategy that we talked about earlier to make sure you are silent the entire time.
Shift walking up to the corner and then jiggle peeking is the safest and most silent way to peek angles without risking your life.. Keep this in mind with almost any angle you peek because you can easily be caught off guard by walking around corners.


<h2>economy</h2>


Our final mistake that we are going to talk about in todays' video is players not balancing their economy correctly.. The economy in Valorant is comparable but very different to any other game in the genre.. The first topic we will talk about is when
to buy and when to save.. We will define a full buy as having a rifle such as the Vandal, and full heavy armor.. This costs 3900 credits total. I see many players full buying as soon as they have enough money. This could actually
be very detrimental to a team if not done correctly. Obviously having better weapons will improve your chances of winning a round, but buying with your team will improve those chances even more. If only 2 on your team have enough to money to full buy, you should all save. When you
save you are essentially giving up the round in an attempt to win the next round. I'm not saying it's impossible to win a save round, but it is definitely harder. You want to always check your teams' economy before buying yourself. This will help your
team all play together on these important buy rounds.
