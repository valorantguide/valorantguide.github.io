<h2>Bad Crosshair Placement</h2>

Crosshair placement is defined as where your crosshair is placed at all times while playing.

One headshot can kill players depending on what gun you use, so you obviously want to aim for the head.

Well, if you are aiming for the head, but your crosshair starts at the enemies chest you have to adjust your mouse vertically and horizontally. 

This forces you to have near perfect aim while trying to hit a headshot on this player.

So instead of having to adjust your entire crosshair vertically and horizontally, you can just always leave your crosshair at about head level.

<h2>Peeking Incorrectly</h2>

How to correctly peek angles will help you take more 1 on 1 fights that are much more winnable than just running out.

One way you can do this is by jiggle peeking. 

Put simply, jiggle peeking is a method of peeking that allows you to quickly gather information on where an enemy is without having to risk your life.

You can execute this peek by walking up to a wall, then quickly clicking back and forth between the A and D keys so that you barely peek out.

Peeking one by one and jiggle peeking will give you way more control over your fights.. Mastering these tactics will lead to you getting more kills and most importantly, staying alive much longer.

<h2>Playing Alone</h2>

Valorant is a very team oriented game, playing it as a solo can be difficult sometimes but learning how to trade kills and play off your teammates is essential to becoming a higher level player.

Let's say you teammate pushes site and dies. You then peek out and kill the player that killed them. This is a perfect example of trading a kill.

Many times, players will sit back and let their teammates die, just to push in later and have the same fate.

Trading kills also helps to keep the team numbers more balanced during game. It can give your team a 4v4 instead of having to try and fight a 5v4.

<a name="reloading"></a>
<h2>Unnecesary Reloading</h2>

This is reloading in the open and near enemies.

First let's talk about when NOT to reload.

To start, I see many new players reload after only shooting a few bullets. 

You should only reload when you absolutely need to OR when you are completely safe. 

It only takes a few bullets to kill someone in Valorant so reloading after only shooting a few is a terrible idea.

<a name="spike"></a>
<h2>Chaotic Spike Defusal</h2>

In Valorant the spike takes exactly 7 seconds to defuse with a halfway point at 3 and a half seconds.

There are a lot of different tactics that you can use when you know this information.

A fake defuse is when you click the defuse button but have no intention to actually defuse the spike. 

This will force the enemies to peek you in order to make sure you aren't actually defusing the spike.

You can tap the bomb and then instantly listen for the enemy to figure out exactly where they are coming from. 

Another strategy is to defuse the spike to the half way point and then get off of the defuse and peek the enemy. 

<a name="mainall"></a>
<h2>Playing all agents/ Not Mastering an Agent</h2>

Playing multiple agents randomly is not going to help you improve faster, the best way to improve fast is by learning 1 agent at a time.

This will allow you to learn all the small things about that one agent and will also allow you to always be comfortable with your abilities and your role in the team. 

<a name="gunall"></a>
<h2>Using Everygun/ Not Mastering a Gun</h2>

Trying to perfect every single gun at a time can be overwhelming.

Learning how to control recoil and spray patterns is certainly a good way to improve, but you want to focus on just a couple at a time so that you can easily master them.

To start I would recommend practicing with the phantom.

You can go here to the training ground and shoot at the target.

Try to get all of your bullets in the inner circle until you can consistently control the spray.

After you learn how to control the phantom, you can switch to the Vandal and practice with it.
Remember, each weapon has a unique spray pattern so learning each one will take time and dedication.

<a name="notshift"></a>
<h2>Not Shift Walking When You Have To</h2>

The sounds that enemies make can provide you with valuable information that will net you some free kills.

On the other hand, other players will use sound against you. 

While shift walking you will not make any footstep noises. This will allow you to surprise enemies that don't know your location.

If you decide to run instead of walk then you put yourself at a disadvantage. This is because the enemy will know exactly where you are and you will have no idea where they are.

Another plus to shift walking is the weapon accuracy.  Even though you may lose some speed while you shift walk, it is still a great idea in most circumstances.

<a name="shift"></a>
<h2>Shift Walking When You Don't Have To</h2>

Even though shift walking is ALMOST always a good idea, there are times where it is not. 

The main time that shift walking is a horrible idea, is when you are peeking an angle. 

When you walk peek an angle the enemy won't hear you, but your shoulder will show before you can actually see the enemy.
Instead of doing this, you actually want to run while you peek it.

What you can do is walk up to wall that you are about to peek. This will allow you to get there without making any noise.

Then you want to let go of shift and peek out normally, in most situations you won't actually move far enough to make noise 

Shift walking up to the corner and then jiggle peeking is the safest and most silent way to peek angles without risking your life.

<a name="economy"></a>
<h2>Economy management</h2>

The first topic we will talk about is when to buy and when to save.

We will define a full buy as having a rifle such as the Vandal, and full heavy armor. This costs 3900 credits total. 

I see many players full buying as soon as they have enough money. This could actually be very detrimental to a team if not done correctly. 

Obviously having better weapons will improve your chances of winning a round, but buying with your team will improve those chances even more. 

If only 2 on your team have enough to money to full buy, you should all save. 

When you save you are essentially giving up the round in an attempt to win the next round.
