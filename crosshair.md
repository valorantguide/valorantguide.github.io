If you're new to the game, just copying what the pros do may not be the fastest way to improve.. So make sure you read Until the end, as we'll be showing you the best crosshair settings to use if you're new to the game, as it's actually a lot different and there are some hidden secret tricks.

Don't worry, it's actually simpler than you realize and we'll be going through each of these settings one by one

<h2>The Color of your crosshair</h2>

When it comes to the top pros, 54% of them are using a Green crosshair. 31% of them are using a White crosshair And 15% of them are using a Cyan crosshair, which is a greenish-blue color. So what's the deal here? Well, when it comes to selecting the color of your crosshair it mainly has to do with having it stand out against the background and enemy character models

This makes sense why a lot of people choose a green crosshair as if you go around the maps you'll notice there simply isn't a lot of green backgrounds.

On the map split it's very white, grey, and brown . On Bind we see a lot of brown, red, tan, and some blue paint. If we go to the map Haven we see the same thing, a lot of grey, brown and tan backgrounds.

Riot has designed it this way on purpose to help enemy models stand out more and it makes sense that so many pros pick Green as this is one color that clashes the least with the background. 
However, that doesn't explain why 31% of them are using a white crosshair. Doesn't this go against what we just said? Given that it would blend it a lot with the grey backgrounds.

Well, yes, and I would say for the vast majority of players a white crosshair is one of the worst to go with. That being said, once you understand how prosare aiming, you can begin to realize why they can use a white crosshair.

You see, the average player actually uses their crosshair to aim, surprising I know. The focus of their eyes are often on the crosshair itself, while their peripheral vision scans for enemies Once they see an enemy in their peripheral vision, they then continue to focus on their crosshair and drag it on top of the enemy, and then shoot.

This is the opposite of what pro players do. They are not focused on their crosshair, and instead are scanning their entire environment around the crosshair.
Once they see an enemy, they then focus their vision on that enemy, and then use their peripheral vision and muscle memory to drag their crosshair onto the enemy.
And because of how much training and practice they have when it comes to doing this, they have an instinctual idea of where the center of their monitor is
So for many pros, they'd rather have their crosshair take up less of the screen and be less visible, so their vision is less obstructed and they can scan their monitor for enemies, and rely on their muscle memory to flick onto the enemy.

There are a couple of other exceptions when it comes to crosshair color.
For example, if you play a lot of Viper well then a green crosshair probably isn't the best choice given that it will blend in with her poison and gets lost in her ultimate.

At the same time, take into consideration the enemy highlight color you've chosen. If enemies are highlighted Red, well then picking a Red colored crosshair is not the right choice since they will blend together.

Overall, we highly recommend you just go with. Green as that's what the majority of the pros go with and there's logical reasons to back it up.

However, if you're going to go with a different color, just make sure it doesn't blend in with the environment, enemy highlight colors, or your main Agents abilities.


<h2>The most important crosshair setting in Valorant: Inner Lines</h2>

This makes up the main body of the crosshair and will determine the shape of it.

Inner Lines has 4 settings associated with it, the first being Inner Line Opacity.
This determines how transparent your crosshair will be and 100% of top pros all have this set to 1, which means it's the most solid it can be.

This makes sense as having a transparent crosshair will make keeping track of it much more difficultand essentially start making it invisible.
Next, we have line length, which will determine how long the inner lines of your crosshair will be. 46% of pros have this set to 4. 23% have it set to 5 And the rest is spread out evenly among the other options.

4 seems to be that sweet spot where it isn't so long that it's distracting and takes up too much of your screen, while it isn't so small that you can barely see it.

Then we have Inner Line Thickness, which determines how thick the inner lines will be. 69% of pros have this set to 2 15% have it set to 1. And the remainder is spread out evenly among the other options.

When you experiment with this setting yourself you will also find anything higher than 2 makes it way too thick, while having it lower than 2 makes it hard to see, so it becomes obvious why the majority of pros have it set to 2.

And lastly we have Inner Line Offset, which will determine how much empty space you have between the inner lines. 38% of pros have this set to 2, 23% have it set to 4 15% have it set to 2 as well as 5. 
And Scream is the outlier that has it set to 0 since he plays only with a dot.

I think this comes down the most to personal preference, where 2 is the standard, keeping your crosshair small, but still visible.. Whereas the pro players who put it higher than 2 want that extra space in the middle of their crosshair to clearly see what they're aiming at

Okay, so what does all of this mean?

 >Well, the most popular crosshair among the pros is a line opacity of 1, line length of 4, line thickness of 2, and line offest of 2.
> 

For example, ShahZam, TenZ, and zombs all have this exact crosshair.

While other notable pros have a slight variation of this 1/4/2/2 theme. For example, sinatraa is 1/4/2/3. Brax is 1/5/2/2 and Hiko is 1/4/2/4.

**Basically, what you should be doing is starting with 1/4/2/2 as your base crosshair. With Line opacity always set as 1, and Line thickness always set to 2. You can then change Line length from 4 and line offset from 2, but keep within a 2 point variance of these benchmarks as almost no pro exceeds them.**

<h2>Outlines</h2>

What this does is draw a black border around the inner lines to help highlight them.

69% of the top pros have this turned off. While 31% have it enabled. It makes sense as to why a lot of pros have this disabled since it indirectly makes your crosshair bigger, taking more of your screen, and for many the black outlines might not even effectively highlight their crosshair for them.

On the other hand, for the pros that do have it enabled, every single one of them has the Opacity set to 1 and Thickness set to 1.

Really what this comes down to, is whether you find the black borders help you keep track of your crosshair or not.

Keep in mind, that previous situation we mentioned of having a green crosshair when playing Viper, well those black borders now help us keep track of our crosshair a little bit better when aiming on top of her green abilities.

This is the main advantage of having it enabled. If you're a more advanced player then you probably don't need the extra help from the black border, whereas if you're newer or have difficulty keeping track of your crosshair then having outlines set to 1 in Opacity and thickness should be what you're doing. 


<h2>The infamous center dot</h2>

85% of the top pros don't use a center dot in their crosshair While 15% do use one. 
Overall, having a center dot is definitely the exception to the rule and it makes sense why.

Essentially, most pros play with their inner line offset set to 2 as we showed in the previous section. This causes them to be so close together that there isn't really room for a dot. If they did add a dot, it would basically just fill in the whole crosshair. 

Hiko is one player that uses a center dot. However, Hiko actually plays with his inner lines much further away than most pros, set to 4 instead of 2 and this gives him the space needed to actually use a center dot. 

And an even bigger exception is ScreaM who only uses a dot with opacity set to 1 and thickness set to 2 


<h2>Outer lines</h2>


These will create lines that are outside of your inner lines.  100% of the top pros have these turned off.

The main use of outer lines is that you can use them as sort of training wheels to enable movement error and firing error so that the outer lines expand when you're inaccurate, while retaining the inner crosshair. 

This is a concept we'll be diving into more detail in later on in the guide when we go over the best beginner crosshair.

For now, all you need to know, is that it's something to be used for newer players that you eventually get rid of since it will only serve to create more visual clutter on your screen. 


<h2>Fade Crosshair with Firing Error</h2>

I bet more than 90% of you didn't even know existed in the game.

When this is turned on it will cause the topline in your crosshair to eventually fade away the more you spray your gun.

**100% of pros have this turned off and for good reason.**

 You want your crosshair to be static, not making constant minute charges between every bullet as it will make it harder to have consistent accuracy. 

<h2>Movement Error and Firing Error</h2>


What these two settings do is cause your crosshair to expand when you move or fire your gun. 

For example, let's say we have movement error enabled.  Now, every time we move our crosshair expands, and every time we stand still it goes back to normal.

What the expansion of the crosshair represents is how inaccurate your bullets will be. The more spread out your crosshair becomes the more inaccurate.

You'll notice when we're standing still we're very accurate, when we walk it expands only a little, so we're still somewhat accurate, then when we run our bullets become wildly innacurate.

You'll also notice that different guns can have worse or better accuracy in different movement states.

For example, the operator is so much inaccurate when moving than the Phantom.

For beginners having this enabled can be very useful since it gives you visual feedback on when you're inaccurate. 

Basically, if you're someone who finds themselves constantly shooting while moving, well then you want Movement Error enabled so that you can see when you're accurate or not.

Firing Error does the exact same thing, except it shows how inaccurate you're being while shooting.

If you do small bursts, your crosshair barely expands as you're fairly accurate.

However, if you spray your gun the crosshair expands a ton representing how inaccurate your bullets are. 

In short, turning on Movement Error and Firing Error is great for beginners as they act like training wheels. A constantl reminder of when you're being inaccurate and why your bullets aren't going where you want them to.

That being said, **100% of pros have this turned off.** This is because they've already developed the muscle memory to know when they're inaccurate due to moving or firing and so they don't need the visual reminder of their crosshair expanding.




<h2>The best beginner crosshair.</h2>

 We put a lot of research into this a consulted with some of the best valorant coaches to come up with two versions of what we think are the best beginner crosshairs.

The first version is most similar to the pro crosshair. This will make it easiest for you to transition from the beginner crosshair to a pro crosshair once you get better at the game.


We essentially keep the same set up as the pro crosshair. Crosshair is green and the Inner lines follow the familiar 1/4/2/2 pattern. 

However, we have movement error and firing error enabled. This will give you visual feedback when your bullets are inaccurate.

We've also turned on Outlines with the opacity and thickness set to 1. This will create a black border around your crosshair making it easier to keep track of.

And finally we have the center dot turned on with the opacity set to 1 and thickness set to 2. This center dot is important, as with movement and firing error turned on our inner lines will constantly be expanding. This center dot will help you stay accurate while learning how bullet accuracy works in valorant.

Just to be clear, this crosshair is for beginners to get used to the movement and firing inaccuracy in Valorant. Eventually, once you've moved past that, we recommend you use this second beginner crosshair to help master spraying and bullet spread in Valorant.

***

We use the exact same set up as the pro crosshair. Crosshair is green and the inner lines have the 1/4/2/2 pattern. However, we have movement error and firing error disabled.

We have Outlines turned on with opacity and thickness set to 1. But we then have the center dot turned off.

 From here, we enable the Outer Lines with the Opacity set to 1, Length set to 2, Thickness set to 2, and most importantly, Offset set to 40. We then disable Movement Error and Firing Error for the outer lines.

What this does is have the standard pro crosshair, but with outer lines around it. 

**What's awesome is that the top outer line can be used for knowing how to aim your crosshair when you fully spray a Vandal or Phantom as this is where bullets will go after your 9th bullet.**

**Watch as I spray the Phantom, the bullets go up until eventually maxing out and staying on the top outer line of the crosshair.**

**This allows you to use the inner crosshair for 1tapping and bursting, while using the top of the outer crosshair to aim when spraying.**
