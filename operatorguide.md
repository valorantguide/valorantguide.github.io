## OPERATOR INDUCTION


> **A good Oper can take over a game and nearly solo carry to victory.**

As we've all probably noticed, the mere existence of an Operator on the battlefield changes the entire dynamic of how the enemy team moves around.


<h2>DAMAGE VALUES </h2>

The most important thing you need know about the damage of the operator is that it does 150 damage to the body.

That means that this gun gives you those satisfying one shot kills everytime you click on someone's body.

But With that being the case though, why would you ever try to click on someone's head.

This is where the biggest difference between the Operator and the normal weapons come in.

While normally you want to try to keep your crosshair placement on the enemies head level, you instead want to keep your crosshair at the enemies chest or collarbone area. 

This gives you the biggest target, because the enemies arms and shoulders count as part of the torso as well and recieve 150 damage.

The legs are a bit different though, and recieve 127 damage when hit with the Operator, which is still a one shot kill to light armor, but legs are much more difficult to hit so make sure to keep that crosshair up to give you the best chance at that one shot kill.

It is important to know though, when you do hit an enemy in the head it deals a whopping 255 damage, which obviously seems like overkill.

BUT, there are so many walls and objects in Valorant that can be shot through that this high damage value pretty much guarantees that no matter what object you're shooting through, if your bullet touches the enemies head, it's going to be a kill.

So the important things to remember here are:

**Aim at the upper body unless you're shooting through a wall, where a headshot is far superior.**

<h2>AUTO RESCOPE</h2>

Valorant has an auto-rescope feature that allows you to scope back in as quickly as possible after firing a shot, this improves how fast you can land your next accurate shot

That split second could be the difference between life or death.


<h2>WHEN TO BUY AN OPERATOR</h2>

It's important to understand when you should be using the Operator, because using the Operator at the wrong time can easily lead to a lost round and a ruined economy 

There are two very powerful scenarios you should consider when using an Operator, when you're contesting mid control from a long angle, or when you're attempting to hold a site solo.

The reason these are great times to use an Operator is because your job as the Oper is to get a pick before the enemy has time to establish themselves in the area they're going for.

For example if you're playing haven's C site and manage to get a quick pick on their entry fragger before they even begin to push, their team's going to think twice before finishing that push, and probably before coming back to the site altogether, and the same goes for mid control on nearly every map.

A basic rule of thumb is if you're contesting a crucial point of the map, and have room to reposition after a shot, the Operator can be a very powerful tool, considering you know how to use it.

Knowing how to use the Operator is the most important thing, because with the sheer damage output of the weapon, if you can master it, you'll find yourself shooting yourself out of some very bad situations.


<h1>AWP PLAYSTYLES</h1>


<h2>Aggressive Oping</h2>

Aggressive Oping is the flashy counter-strike like Oping that everyone wants to pull off because it just looks so cool when you can make it happen, but it's just not as effective in this game for a few different reasons.

The buy phase allows the defenders to get set up in position on site before the round, making catching defenders in rotation much more difficult.

There's also a slower scope-in time that gives you that little bit more of a delay when peeking around a corner before you can hit an accurate shot not to mention the slow movement speed is pretty unforgiving as well.

All of these things being said though there are a ton of aggressive ways to use the Operator that are still viable, like showers or mid
on bind from attackers side.
Both of these angles require you to peek quickly and go for a fast shot, because it's very common to catch a defender off guard going for an aggressive play. and that's the best way to Op aggressively, push up to an unpredictable angle, and punish the enemies aggression.


<h2>Defensive Oping</h2>

Defensive Oping is by far the most effective way to utilize the weapon because if the enemy pushes an angle that you're already holding, it almost guarantees you a kill.

Combining that with the ability to constantly fall back and reposition to stay unpredictable, allows the enemy to constantly push up into your angle, and get picked off over and over.

This makes defensive Oping the best for locking down sites on defense, and cutting off rotations and flanks on attack.

This kind of domination of an area is often enough to win rounds and games because often establishing that dominance in an area gives you enough map control to out maneuver your opponents as a team.


<h2>Quick Scoping</h2>

Quick scoping has been a staple in shooter for a very long time, and in Valorant is no exception.

Although quick scoping in Valorant isn't quite as effective as in some titles, the scope in time isn't so long as to make it ineffective, 

In fact, if you're standing still, you only have to wait until the frame that you can see in your scope to have a completely accurate shot, and although you should try to avoid quick scoping, it can be a great way out of a sticky midrange situation.

<h2>No Scoping</h2>

No scoping in valorant is actually not too bad, think of your operator as a slug shotgun that is only really accurate at extremely close ranges.
You can turn your crosshair with movement error on to see where your bullet can go, and you'll notice that since you can actually be quite deadly in those closer ranges.

So no matter what, dont be afraid to take your shot, because lie we talked about earlier, it only takes one.



<h2>Who should i pick to play with the Operator?</h2>

For attackers side Jett is the obvious favorite because her mobility allows her to get quick picks, lock down areas, all while being able to get back to her team very quickly.

Raze is another character that is often overlooked and underestimated, but with the mobility that Razes satchels give her she can take some insanely aggressive peeks while still being ready to hit that shot.

For defenders side it gets a lot more lenient, with jett being a front runner again because of her mobility and ability to hold uncommon angles, but characters like Sage, Cypher, and viper, aside from when she uses her ult, all perform extremely well with an Operator because it amplifies their ability to hold down a site solo, allowing their team to play in pairs or stack a site.


<h1>HOW TO USE AN OPERATOR</h1>

<h2>Peeking</h2>

the biggest mistake I see newer players make is crouch peeking.

Crouch peeking with the Operator is a no go, and when I say crouch peeking I mean crouching, aiming down the scope, and walking out around
the corner.

This peek is just so slow that you're almost guaranteed to get shot before you even see the enemy.

Instead, crouch peek by peeking out, and immediately scoping in and crouching at the same time.

This way you're peeking out as fast as possible, while moving your hitbox, and preparing to shoot the enemy all at the same time.

**The most common and effective peek you can make with the Operator is to perfect peek, which means to peek your body out the smallest amount as possible.**

You want to combine this peek with isolating the angle as best as possible, meaning you should try to peek only one angle at a time,
 

Although this standard peek is probably going to net you the most kills, there's also jump peeking, and repeeks.

Jump peeking is the act of jumping out past the corner instead of walking past it, in an attempt to go farther than the enemies crosshair, giving you time to scope in and click on their body before they can adjust to your unpredictable peek.

 This is a great way to be unpredictable and punish an enemy for playing too safe on an angle, and this is also a borderline OP strategy when used in conjunction with Raze's satchels.

Finally we come to repeeks, the downfall of many players in valorant, because when you miss that first shot we're all compelled to swing it and try it again.

If you're going to repeek, most of the time the best option you have is the crouch peek like we talked about before, because after the first encounter the enemy is likely preaiming at your head level, so crouching will likely make them miss their shot, allowing you to pick up that easy frag.


The safer option for re peeking is to go back to the same angle, but hold it closer and from an off angle, that way they have to push up just a bit further and you still have holder's advantage with the one shot kill weapon.

**Overall though, when on defense, it's usually better to just play it extreemly safe and fall back to reposition**

<h2>Positioning</h2>

Holding a bad angle or being too predictable can cause you to die, and dying with an operator is usually a lost round because you're  Supposed to be holding a very important area of the map.

As you probably already know, the longer the angle the better for the Operator, because there is no bullet drop off, and when going head to head with a vandal or a phantom at long range, the Operator will easily win out nine out of ten times.

> **When going head to head with a vandal or a phantom at long range, the Operator will easily win out nine out of ten times.**

But there are more to holding and peeking angles than just how far away you are to the target.


Tight angles:

Tight angles are very effective for holding a site solo because the goal is to peek an angle, while seeing the smallest amount of the enemy as possible, because the less you see of them, the less they see of you.

Sometimes you're going to run into people with godlike aim, and taking a straight up gunfight with them is difficult, so this tight angle peek is very important to gathering information on the enemy team, while still being nearly impossible to kill.

This allows your team to rotate early and get the positional advantage on the enemy team.

Off angles:

Sometimes in games you're feeling an area of the map, you're getting kills and right in that particular area, but you can feel yourself getting a bit predictable, well off angles are always an option. 

an off-angle is an unpredictable angle that the enemy isn't used to seeing. This means that you should be pushing out into the other side of the angle that you normally hold, or jett boosting on top of something like the middle box on B site Haven.

These off angles are very powerful to catch the enemy off guard, because it's very difficult to have good crosshair placement on an off angle, and the enemies reaction time will be severely reduced because they don't expect the angle.

Just make sure you're careful with the off angles, because the last thing you want is to be predictable in an off angle.

<h2>RE-Positioning</h2>

The first tip I have is whenever you take a shot, you can do something that is called a quick switch.

The basics of quick switching is to press 3 take out your knife after you shoot, giving you the extra movement speed to allow you to get back behind cover.

You can combine this with a jump to allow you to maintain that knife movement speed, while pressing 1 to pull your operator back out, allowing you to be ready to shoot again from a much safer place than you would be if you kept the operator out and tried to walk away with the slower movement speed.

But this still begs the question, where should you reposition to? 

**You want to make sure that you're unpredictable.**

You should also keep in mind that if you're using an Operator, the other team knows that they need to flank you and catch you off guard if they want to have a chance to kill you. 

With that being said, if you're playing attacker, after your first shot, it's almost always a good idea to reposition to an angle where you can hold the flank, because it seems like everyone is flanking in Valorant 

Even if no one flanks though, that guaranteed safety still makes it worth it because your team can have the confidence to play their game knowing no one is going to come and shoot them in the back.

 Another great way to reposition is to find an angle that allows you to cut off rotation, even if it's an unlikely rotation, being able
to guarantee that they cant rotate through that area provides benefit for your team.

Finally one of the best ways to reposition is to hold the same area, but from a bit safer location. Like A long on Haven. After taking a shot there, repositioning to the boxes on site allows you to keep control of that entrance to A, by forcing them to push deeper into your line of site.

The Common trend with all of these repositions is maintaining some control of the map, because even if you're only controlling a small portion of the map, that small portion benefits your team more than you know. 

<h2>Countering an Operator</h2>

First things first, you should hit that Tab button, and see if the enemy has more than 4500 credits.

because if the answer is no then you dont have to worry about it and you can push site freely, but if they do, then you have to start thinking about the following strategies.

**FORCE THEM TO ROTATE**
The most effective way to deal with an Oper is to force them to rotate.

Sometimes this can be a little complicated, but most of the time it's as simple as pushing the site that the Operator isn't playing since retaking a site with an operator is much more difficult than defending one. 

**USE YOUR UTILITY**

If you know where the enemy Op is playing Sometimes all it takes is a Breach flash to take care of them because once they give up
the initial angle, repeeking gets much more difficult.

Worst case scenario though, just smoke off the enemy Oper's angle to force them to take a more difficult angle, or allow you to get close to them. 

**PEEKING WITH A BUDDY**


When I say peek with a buddy I mean you have to both have your guns out ready to fire, because as soon as one person dies, the other has to be ready to shoot the Oper so they get slowed and you have the chance to finish them off.

The Operator is specialized in taking out one enemy and falling back, so forcing him to face multiple enemies at once is the key.
 
**BAIT THEM**

Sometimes you have to face an Operator solo though, and the best way to deal with them in that situation is to bait out their shot, and the shoulder peek is the best way to do it.

Shoulder peeking entails you sticking your shoulder out just far enough to bait that first shot on the enemy Oper, and immediately
peeking while he is repositioning or chambering that next shot.

All in all though, if you find a good mix of these strategies in game, you'll have the enemy Oper wasting their money in no time.
